# Python Projects Repository

This repository is a comprehensive collection of Python projects that cover fundamental to advanced concepts of the Python programming language. It includes practical examples and exercises for a wide range of topics, including modules, variables, data types, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, conditionals, loops, functions, recursion, file I/O, object-oriented programming, inheritance, and advanced Python features. Each chapter contains a set of practice exercises to solidify the concepts learned.
